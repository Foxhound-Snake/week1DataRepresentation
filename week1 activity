week 1 activity questions:

What strategies you will use to perform a bitwise XOR operation when plaintext and key have different lengths?
-a strategy i could use is to simply repeat the word to match the length of the key/message

What were your challenges in performing the lab (from design to the implementation phases)?
-it took me a decent amount of time to correctly convert my message/key to binary.
